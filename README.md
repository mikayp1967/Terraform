# Terraform examples/testing

## master branch for newer Terraform code/projects

kube (TF 1.0.6 - random choice I know, not the first 1.0 version & not bleeding edge...)

I need a simple kube cluster to start testing on so here it is. 


## TF011 branch - code for Terraform 0.11.15


To use this you will need to be on branch TF011 otherwise pointing at modules 
and stuff won't work. This was just simple junk for the sake of doing some TF0.11 stuff 
so will likely not see much action

I started a small basic network and I guess a couple of days later I abandoned it.
Not a lot of point - it's just for the sake of doing it, it's old terraform just 
to prove I can I guess.

I've coded this in TF-0.11.15, there's a lot of legacy code around using
this version. I'll do future projects in newer TF



## old-stuff

This is some stuff I did a few years ago. I'm not sure exactly what
is in here, I need to tidy it up sometime
